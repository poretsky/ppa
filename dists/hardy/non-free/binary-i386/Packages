Description: software Russian TTS engine
 This is a Russian speech synthesizer.
 it takes Russian text in koi8-r charset as an input
 and produces digital sound stream in the raw linear
 signet 8-bit 10 kHz format for the output.
 It doesn't actually play this sound. You should use
 some player for it like sox for example.
 .

Description: multilingual software speech synthesizer
 This package provides Thierry Dutoit's phonemizer for multilingual
 speech synthesis. The various diphone databases are distributed on separate
 packages, but they must be used with and only with Mbrola because of license
 matters. Read the copyright for details.
 .
 Mbrola itself doesn't provide full TTS. It is a speech synthesizer based on
 the concatenation of diphones. It takes a list of phonemes as input,
 along with prosodic information (duration of phonemes and a piecewise linear
 description of pitch), and produces speech samples on 16 bits (linear),
 at the sampling frequency of the diphone database.
 .
 Use Mbrola along with Freephone to have a complete text-to-speech in English.

Description: British English male voice for Mbrola
 This package provides a British English male voice (known as "Roger's
 voice") to be used with the Mbrola program. It has been built from the
 original Roger diphones made available by CSTR, University of Edinburgh,
 as part of their generic text-to-speech system Festival.
 .
 http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival.html
 .
 Input files use the SAMPA phonetic notation, as adopted in other Mbrola
 databases. This package also provides the correspondence with the MRPA
 phonetic notation used in the original distribution of Roger's voice
 in the Festival TTS system.

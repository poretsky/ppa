Description: Media collection catalogue
 The main purpose of this package is to keep and manage simple media
 collection catalogue providing easy data access and control means from
 within Emacs. Initially it was designed for keeping CD/DVD collection,
 but nothing prevents it from using with another content, such as paper
 books or something else. Nevertheless, there is an extra advantage
 especially for CD and DVD, since these media types can be
 automatically identified and recognized being put into the drive.

Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
 .
 Emacspeak is built on
 top of Emacs.  Once Emacs is started with Emacspeak loaded, users get
 spoken feedback for all actions.  As Emacs can do everything,
 they get speech feedback for everything they do.
 .
 This package also includes speech server written in Tcl to support
 the DECtalk Express speech synthesizer and remote speech server
 access scripts.  For other synthesizers, look for separate
 speech server packages such as emacspeak-espeak, emacspeak-outloud,
 multispeech and eflite.
